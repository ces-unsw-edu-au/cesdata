It seems the time has arrived...\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nLong time ago I started to use [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for the documentation of each dataset used for different analysis and adopted a consistent folder structure to help me navigate these datasets. Also I started using [git](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/git-novice-branch-pr/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/jrfep) to keep track of the updates and changes. \\n\\nSo I think I already had most of the ingredients that I needed. I was just lacking a cool system to bring this all together in an organised way. \\n\\nOver the years I have experimented with different approaches to build websites: php, content management systems, [shiny apps](https://ecosphere.shinyapps.io/tutorial-1-create-spatial-object/), [flask](https://github.com/jrfep/fireveg-webapp), hugo, jekyll, [quarto](https://github.com/red-list-ecosystem/T6.1-SA-01-VE-01-Cordillera-Merida), [rmarkdown](https://jrfep.github.io/), rblogdown, etc. \\n\\nSo many options!\\n\\nSo, which should I choose for this site? Since all these documents were already in markdown and the code was not supposed to be re-run constantly I just need a very straightforward, no non-sense system that transforms this collection into a clear structure with easy navigation. Blog post would be nice, that way I could add some comments to the growing collection of documents, but they should not distract that much from the main feature. \\n\\nHow did I get the idea of using docusaurus?\\n\\nMaybe from here: https://dev.to/mxglt/some-great-tools-to-create-a-static-site-from-your-markdown-documentation-mke or here: https://dev.to/mxglt/docusaurus-or-the-simpliest-way-to-do-a-technical-documentation-4om4\\n\\nSo, is this the way to get this site started and share all this knowledge with the world?\\n\\nMaybe it is, I will give it a try."},{"id":"forest-macrogroups-americas","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/forest-macrogroups-americas","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-10-Forest-Macrogroups.md","title":"Distribution maps for the Forest macrogroups","description":"I have been asked a couple of times to share the maps of the forest macrogroups that we assessed with the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems back in 2019.","date":"2023-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 10, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Distribution maps","permalink":"/blog/tags/distribution-maps"},{"label":"IUCN RLE","permalink":"/blog/tags/iucn-rle"},{"label":"OSF","permalink":"/blog/tags/osf"},{"label":"OSF cloud storage","permalink":"/blog/tags/osf-cloud-storage"},{"label":"QGIS","permalink":"/blog/tags/qgis"},{"label":"GPKG","permalink":"/blog/tags/gpkg"},{"label":"IVC macrogroups","permalink":"/blog/tags/ivc-macrogroups"}],"readingTime":1.71,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\xe9 R.

Vegetation macrogroups are one level of the* International Vegetation Classification* (know as IVC or EcoVeg[^3]), I have included in our documentation an entry with download scripts for several datasets related to the: [-> Go to the entry](/docs/vegetation/regional/IVC-potential-macrogroups).\\n\\n### Original raster data\\nThe original spatial data of the vegetation macrogroups for North and South America was prepared by NatureServe and should be available in their data portals:\\n\\n- [geohub](https://geohub-natureserve.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/Natureserve::macrogroups-of-the-americas-1/explore?location=2.669578%2C114.745000%2C2.74) \\n- [MapServer](https://securemaps.natureserve.org/pub2/rest/services/Americas/Macrogroup/MapServer) \\n\\n### Derived vector data\\nI created my own version of the potential distribution maps and shared them in one [OSF repository](https://osf.io/wme3b). \\n\\nMany people have requested vector data, so I exported this using the Geopackage (\\".gpkg\\") format. This format should open in open source software like QGIS without any problem.\\n\\n\\n[^1]: Ferrer-Paris, J. R., Zager, I., Keith, D. A., Oliveira-Miranda, M., Rodr\xedguez, J.

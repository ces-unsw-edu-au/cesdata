# LBA-ECO LC-08 Soil, Vegetation, and Land Cover Maps for Brazil and South America

https://daac.ornl.gov/LBA/guides/LC08_EOS_Maps.html

This data set provides (1) soil maps for Brazil that are digital versions of the MAPA DE SOLOS DO BRASIL (EMBRAPA, 1981) classified at three levels of detail, 19-class, 70-class and 249-class; (2) vegetation maps for Brazil that are digital versions of the MAPA DE VEGETACAO DO BRASIL (IBGE, 1988) classified at three levels of detail, 13-class, 59-class, and an overprint (combination) class; and (3) a land cover map for all of South America that was derived from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data over the time period 1987 through 1991 (Stone et al., 1994).

The seven soil, vegetation, and general land cover classification maps are provided as GeoTIFF files (.tif) files. There are also three companion files (.pdf), one each, for the soil, vegetation, and land cover maps, with information on  map units, class values, codes, and descriptions.

Soils Maps:

The soil maps of Brazil are digital versions of the MAPA DE SOLOS DO BRASIL (EMBRAPA, 1981), digitized at the U.S. Geological Survey's EROS Data Center, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in 1992.

These data were acquired from the Woods Hole Research Center and modified for incorporation in the University of New Hampshire (UNH) EOS-WEBSTER system. The subset for the LBA study region was downloaded from EOS-WEBSTER.

The files were processed with ArcInfo, and based on the Woods Hole Full Soil Map Unit Classifications. There are three soil maps available as three different classes: one 19-class, one 70-class, and one 249, detailed class. Refer to the companion file Brazil_Soils_Map_class_aux.pdf for the class value codes and names.

Vegetation Maps:

The vegetation maps of Brazil are digital versions of the MAPA DE VEGETACAO DO BRASIL (IBGE, 1988), digitized at the U.S. Geological Survey's EROS Data Center, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in 1992.  These data were acquired from the Woods Hole Research Center.

Data are generalizations of the major vegetation classes. Generalized classes were determined from the original subheadings on the original published map.

Overprint classes are used to define areas which are best described by a combination of two classes, one from the major classification and the other from the overprint classification. Overprint classes were originally displayed with special symbols printed over major classification shades on the original map. For instance, a series of stipple marks or hash marks were printed on top of major class shades to represent areas which had characteristics from the major classification as well as the overprint classification. The overprint classifications were also referred to as subclasses in the original data.

The files were processed with ArcInfo, and based on the Woods Hole General Vegetation Classification. There are three vegetation maps available as three different classes: one 19-class, one 70-class, and one 249, detailed class. Refer to the companion file BrazilVegMap_class_aux.pdf for the class value codes and names.

Land cover map:

The land cover map of South America  was produced from 1-15 km National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data over the time period 1987 through 1991. The data were acquired from Woods Hole Research Center.

The file was processed with ArcInfo and resulted in a 1-km resolution, 41-class, land cover map of South America. Refer to the companion file SA_lc_Map_41class_aux.pdf for the class values and names.

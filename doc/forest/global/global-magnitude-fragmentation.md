# Relative Magnitude of Fragmentation (RMF)

> We use an existing spatially contiguous, global remote-sensing data product (i.e. the 27-year annual ESA CCI land cover maps which can be categorized as an EBV ‘Ecosystem Distribution’) to derive an annual (27 year) time-series of the Relative Magnitude of Fragmentation (RMF) at a global scale and with a spatial resolution of 300m. From this derived EBV data product, we can calculate a RMF indicator of ecosystem degradation, i.e. the change, ...

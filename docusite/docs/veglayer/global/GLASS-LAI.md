# GLASS LAI

Global gridded monthly mean Leaf Area Index (LAI) for five Plant Functional Types (PFTs) derived from the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) products for the period 2000-2014

> This data set is derived from an improved version of long time series of LAI - http://www.glass.umd.edu/LAI/MODIS/0.05D/ - from the original Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) products. The GLASS LAI product spans the period 1981 to 2014 and has a temporal resolution of 8 days. The data is based on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) reflectance data during the period 1981-1999 at a spatial resolution of 0.05â—¦ on a geographic latitude/longitude projection. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data provided in a sinusoidal projection at a spatial resolution of 1km is used to derive the GLASS LAI product during 2000-2014.  Even though the GLASS product has been validated thoroughly over the entire 1981-2014 period, due to issues of instrumental homogeneity, only data from MODIS is used here. Hence, this LAI ancillary product is a climatology of 15 years covering 2000-2014.

> For the GIS-users the map is distributed in two different formats: as zipped ASCII-grid that can be easily imported in most GIS-software that supports raster data or grids; and, to accommodate people who use GIS-software that doesn't support raster data or grids, as a zipped ESRI shape files. It should be noted, however, that the values in the ASCII-grids have a precision of 6 decimals while the values in the shape-file have a precision of 2 decimals. For model calculations it is therefore recommended to use the grid-version. As a service to those people who would need to know the absolute area equipped for irrigation, another ASCII-grid is available in which the area equipped for irrigation is expressed in hectares per cell. Non-GIS-users can download the map as PDF-file in two different resolutions.

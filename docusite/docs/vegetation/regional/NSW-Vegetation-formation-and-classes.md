# Vegetation Formations and Classes of NSW

> This vegetation map shows the extant distributions of vegetation formations and classes throughout NSW, and provides users with information about the resolution, currency and uncertainties in the underlying data that were used to assemble the map. Data represents NSW native vegetation extent, compiled from various vegetation maps using methods outlined in Simpson et al. (2011) and in Keith and Simpson (2010). The NSW vegetation map (version 2.2, Keith and Simpson 2006) was revised by interpreting additional candidate maps as vector layers and synthesising these into a single raster-based data set.

## Versions

Version numbers are confusing, and not linked in SEED

- The main links reported in this document refer to version 3.03 (2012? updated 2017?)
- There is also a [version 2 available on SEED](https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/vegetation-formations-and-classes-of-nsw-version-2-david-a-keith-christopher-c-simpson-b0fef) 
- For version 2 there is also a [extant native vegetation layer](https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-extant-native-vegetation-keith-and-simpson-2006-version-0021b84f).

## Data download and preparation

```sh
source ~/proyectos/CES/cesdata/env/project-env.sh
mkdir -p $GISDATA/vegetation/regional/NSW-veg-forms-classes/
cd $GISDATA/vegetation/regional/NSW-veg-forms-classes/

wget --continue https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/31986103-db62-4994-9702-054949281f56/resource/34a8cc72-5753-4993-8957-8d8af4fab008/download/ygeonetworkzipsvegetationnswmap3848.zip

```

### Uncompress into a working directory

```sh
cd $WORKDIR
unzip $GISDATA/vegetation/regional/NSW-veg-forms-classes/ygeonetworkzipsvegetationnswmap3848.zip
```

The `Vegetation_NSWmap3848/Documents` subfolder contains several reports and descriptions of the data. 

### Use the data in R

The `Vegetation_NSWmap3848/Data` subfolder has the raster file in GeoTiff format with an attribute table in dbf format 

```sh
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(dplyr)

setwd("~/workdir/tmp/cesdata")
veg_map <- read_sf("Vegetation_NSWmap3848/Data/GDB/MapData.gdb/")
veg_map <- read_sf("Vegetation_NSWmap3848/Data/GeoTIFF/NSWmap_v3_03_E_3848.tif.vat.dbf")
veg_map_rast <- rast("Vegetation_NSWmap3848/Data/GeoTIFF/NSWmap_v3_03_E_3848.tif")

veg_map %>% filter(ClassNumbe %in% 52) %>% select(Value,ClassName)

slc <- veg_map %>% 
            filter(ClassNumbe %in% 52) %>% 
            pull(Value) 

plot(veg_map_rast %in% {slc})

veg_map %>% filter(ClassNumbe %in% 60) %>% select(Value,ClassName)

slc <- veg_map %>% 
            filter(ClassNumbe %in% 60) %>% 
            pull(Value) 

plot(veg_map_rast %in% {slc})

```

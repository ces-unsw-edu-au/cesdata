I have been documenting these datasets for the past three years, adding details and details, and the list keeps growing... 

I always had the feeling these docs needed to be shared in a more reader-friendly site. It seems the time has arrived...

<!--truncate-->

Long time ago I started to use markdown for the documentation of each dataset and adopted a consistent folder structure to help me navigate the datasets. Also I started using git and GitHub to keep track of the updates and changes. 

So I think I already had most of the ingredients that I needed. I was just lacking a cool system to bring this all together in an organised way. 

Over the years I have experimented with different approaches to build websites: php, content management systems, shiny apps, flask, hugo, jekyll, quarto, rblogdown, etc. So many options. 

Since all these documents were already in markdown and the code was not supposed to be re-run constantly I just need a very straightforward, no non-sense system that transforms this collection into a clear structure with easy navigation. Blog post would be nice to add some comments to the growing collection of documents, but they should not distract that much from the main feature. 

How did I get the idea of using docusaurus?

Maybe from here: https://dev.to/mxglt/some-great-tools-to-create-a-static-site-from-your-markdown-documentation-mke or here: https://dev.to/mxglt/docusaurus-or-the-simpliest-way-to-do-a-technical-documentation-4om4

So is this the way to get this share this site?
